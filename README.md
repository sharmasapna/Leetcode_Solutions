### Leetcode_Solutions  
Python solution to Leetcode Questions.   
This is a very good platform to learn best practices of python coding.   
I am compiling solutions to some questions as I solve and have tried to include as many comments as possible for easy understanding.   
(Tip: The best way I think is to print and see what exactly is being executed !)   
Just keep Practicing !
